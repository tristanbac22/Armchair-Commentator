# Armchair Commentator

## Description
    My first javascript project is a fun project that prints 
    random text messages from a defined list. The messages are fun 
    little pokes at the comments people make when watching a professional
    sport or competition. They range from ones I have said 
    to ones I have heard others say.

### Purpose
    Practice what I have learned from javascript tutorials,
    implementing Git version control and project management. 

### Tech
    + Javascript
    + Git
    + NodeJS

### Instructions
    1. Check if NodeJS is installed
        Update or install NodeJS 
    2. Clone repository
    3. Open VSstudio or other IDE
        Open AcrmchairCOmmentator folder to main.js
    4. Run in terminal using $ 'node main.js'
    5. The project will print 5 random commentary messages.
        Potential extension would be to print a random message every 15 seconds
